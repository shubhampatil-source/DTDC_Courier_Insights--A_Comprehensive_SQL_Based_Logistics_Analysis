DTDC Courier Insights: A Comprehensive SQL-Based Logistics Analysis

Welcome to DTDC Courier Insights, a data-driven project that dives deep into the logistics and operational efficiency of DTDC Courier services using MySQL as the core analytical tool.
This project simulates a real-world scenario of a logistics company handling thousands of daily shipments across India. Using raw shipment data across sender/receiver locations, weights, delivery times, VAS charges, and modes of transport, we analyze trends, inefficiencies, and performance metrics.

Project Objective:
To perform in-depth consignment analysis using MySQL by leveraging a courier service dataset and focusing on:

•	Operational efficiency

•	Consignment cost structure

•	Financial metrics

•	Geo-Logistics Optimization

•	Exception & Risk Management

•	Client behavior


Dataset Source: Dataset used for this project is available publicly on kaggle.

Key Insights and Findings:
1. Operational Efficiency:

• Average turnaround time: Between all mode of transports average turnaround time is consistent to approx 3 days. Air Cargo, expected to be the fastest, leads marginally — but not significantly. Express and Surface are performing on par with air cargo.  Low Standard Deviation across all three modes (1.4–1.42) suggests that: Turnaround times are consistent and there is no major variance between best- and worst-case delivery times.

• High standard deviation areas: Every Route has standard deviation between 1.4-1.6. Volume of consignments at high standard deviation 1.6 is around 35-45. At every routes volume of consignments is at least in range of 30-50. Need to review how to increase volume by implementing competitive prices or improving delivery time by understanding overall data of competitors.

• Consignments handled per day: Consistent Volume is observed where consignment volumes hover tightly around 1,650–1,700 per day. This indicates a stable operational workload.

• Maximum and Minimum consignments handled per day: The gap of 171 consignments shows an approx 10% fluctuation between the busiest and lightest days. This is moderate — not extreme, but should still be factored into planning.

• Count of days where numbers of consignments are above average: Average consignment volume is only exceeded on approx 23% of the days. This suggests that consignment load is concentrated on a few high-volume days, while the rest of the period sees relatively lower or below-average activity. Ops team can plan resources based on consignment spikes and lulls.

• Booking codes experience higher delivery times across cities: Inefficient Codes like BR926 should be kept under review in future. And also review reason behind delays happened in past even volume they have is minimum. 

• Idle count detection: Count of consignments out of 49629 consignments 3799 consignments where the delivery gap is unusually high compared to similar routes.


2. Geo-Logistics Optimization:

• Routes with high delivery gap:  Higher delivery gap is observed in mode of transport 80% in surface and 20% in express. Routes which observe higher delivery gaps are Nagpur - Kochi, Chennai - Patna, Ranchi - Chandigarh, Agra - Jamshedpur, Kolkata - Bhubaneswar. Volume of consignments on each route ranges around 25-40.

• Top 5 routes operate with high efficiency and low efficiency: High efficiency routes observed in this are Dehradun - Agra, Bhopal - Jaipur, Guwahati - Raipur, Mumbai - Coimbatore, Guwahati - Varanasi. Low efficiency Routes observed are Delhi - Agra, Thiruvananthapuram -Shimla, Meerut - Vijayawada, Guwahati - Vizag, Amritsar - Ahmedabad. High-efficiency lanes worth expanding and revise pricing for low-efficiency routes.

• Routes with the highest consignment volume and weight: Routes with high consignment volume like Srinagar – Kochi and Jamshedpur-Hyderabad also show high total weight, implying predominantly bulk consignments rather than lightweight or document parcels.


3. Consignment Cost Structure:

• Average cost per kg by mode: Express is the most expensive mode per kg Likely due to faster delivery expectations. Air Cargo is mid-tier in cost which is usually used for faster but moderately priced consignments. Surface is most cost efficient may be because per-unit transport cost is lower despite longer delivery time

• High VAS charges routes: Routes involving Tier 2 and 3 cities (e.g., Jamshedpur, Indore, Coimbatore, and Dehradun) are frequently on this list. Possible reasons may be infrastructure gaps requiring extra services.

• Margin of total revenue spent on VAS charges: 13.23% of total revenue is used for vas charges. 


4. Financial metrics:

• State level revenue by each mode of transportation in percentage: Surface contributes approx 50% of revenue in each state operationally, possibly due to cost efficiency and nature of consignments which is high volume and non-urgent.

• Total revenue, VAS charge margin and profitability index of each mode of transport and correlation with volume of consignments: Major contribution to revenue is done by surface mode of transport with highest observed volume of consignments and also percent Vas charge margin from revenue is highest in Surface which is 16%. But Profitability index is highest in express mode 727 of transport mainly due to premium prices for fast delivery.

• Top 5 senders state contributing highest total revenue across all consignments, their vas charge margin and profitability index: Major volumes of high revenue orders are received from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. Profitability index is consistent through all top 5 states in range 500-510.


5. Exception & Risk Management:

• Deviation of actual weight and chargeable weight: 34.28% of consignments have a significant weight deviation. Data inconsistencies observed which shows incorrect weight capture during booking. Packaging factors can be one of the reasons where Bulky items with low actual weight.


6. Route & Mode Profitability Matrix:

• Routes and mode of transport combinations generate high revenue but have low shipment volume: Mostly in surface mode of transportation high revenue at low consignment volume is observed. Vijayawada –Delhi, Thiruvananthapuram – Varanasi, Aurangabad – Vijayawada, Jaipur – Aurangabad, Ludhiana-Chandigarh are routes where we observed consistent revenue of Rs.16,000.


7. Client Behavior:

• Top Clients: Most consistent consignments are received from Keer PLC and Kala Group.



Conclusion: 


•	Operational workflows are stable, to add more efficiency in operations route-level optimization, booking code auditing, and volume balancing should be done.

•	In mode of transportations surface dominates in volume and revenue. But express mode yields superior per-unit profitability. This creates an opportunity to up sell value-driven consignments.

•	Cost and delay hotspots in Tier-2 routes show underlying infrastructure issues.

•	A significant portion of revenue is driven by a limited number of high-performing origin-destination routes and key clients. Need to focus on improving routes and customers with average performance to make the business more stable and grow faster.

•	Exception handling needs a stronger data governance framework, especially around weight misreporting and unusual delivery gaps.
